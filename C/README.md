# RAYTRACER

---

Author : Riccardo Striano SM3201366

This raytracer is the C Project for the "Programmazione Avanzata e Parallela"'s final exam (year 2024/2025).

---

This project aims to implement a simple raytracer capable of build the 2d view from a fixed point of view given a scene made only of spheres.
The Exam's pdf presents a lot more details about how this is implemented and all the files are commented to explain it even further

Here we write just the **main usage**:

1. Use *make all* to make all the binary file and the main file
2. Use *./main* to execute the main file
    **Note**
    The main has **4 optional parameters** that can be passed by terminal:
        a. **_scene_path_** : where the scene is located
        b. **_img_path_** : where the image is located
        c. **_width_** : width of the image
        d. **_height_** : height of the image
